    I graduated from the Technion in 2014 and have a bachelor degree in civil engineering.<br>
    I was specialized in water engineering. <br>
    After a few years of working in that area I realized I need a change to a more interseting and challenging area.<br>
    I was exposed to "She Codes" and started the Basic Python course and found it very fun. <br>
    I love to learn new things and I am very excited to have the oportunity of becoming a programmer.<br><br>
